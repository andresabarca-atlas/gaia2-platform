# GAIA 2.0: Global Assessment of Impacts and Amenazas

An open methodology and platform developed by the **Inter-American Development Bank** for estimating the annual average impact of natural hazards on people, weighted by socioeconomic characteristics.

# ✨ Description

The GAIA 2.0 computation engine is implemented in a set of Python modules developed by the Disaster Risk Management Team of the Inter-American Development Bank. The architecture separates the calculation logic from the orchestration layer, facilitating integration with external web platforms and extension to new hazard types and countries.

> Current pilot: **Ecuador, flood hazard.**

## Modules

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `run_floods_ecuador.py` | Main orchestration script: loads config, runs the 5-step pipeline, and writes outputs |
| `methodology/common/exposure.py` | Shared utilities: population raster → points, Relative Wealth Index (RWI) assignment |
| `methodology/floods/impact.py` | Flood-specific: array-based exposure sampling, AAP calculation, boundary aggregation |
| `config/settings.yaml` | All configurable parameters (return periods, flood threshold) and data paths |

# ⚙️ Prerequisites

Python 3.10 or higher with the following packages:

```
geopandas>=0.14
pandas>=2.0
numpy>=1.26
rasterio>=1.3
shapely>=2.0
pyogrio>=0.9
pyproj>=3.6
pyyaml>=6.0
```

Installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/gaia2-platform.git
cd gaia2-platform
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# 🚀 Usage

## Run the analysis

```bash
python run_floods_ecuador.py
# or with a custom config:
python run_floods_ecuador.py --config config/settings.yaml
```

This script executes the full 5-step pipeline using the data configured in `config/settings.yaml`:

1. Loads GADM ADM2 administrative boundaries
2. Converts the WorldPop population raster to a point cloud (~3.5M points for Ecuador)
3. Assigns the Meta Relative Wealth Index (RWI) via nearest-neighbor spatial join
4. Samples flood depth at each population point for each return period
5. Computes the **Annual Average affected Population (AAP)** via trapezoidal integration

Outputs are written to the directory specified in `config/settings.yaml` (`outputs/` by default).

## Input files

| File | Format | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gadm41_ECU_2.shp` | Shapefile | GADM v4.1 ADM2 administrative boundaries for Ecuador |
| `ecu_pop_*.tif` | GeoTIFF (100m) | WorldPop 2025 population raster |
| `ecu_relative_wealth_index.csv` | CSV (`latitude`, `longitude`, `rwi`) | Meta Relative Wealth Index |
| `Flood/RP_{rp}/Ecuador.tif` | GeoTIFF | Flood depth rasters per return period (m) |

# 📖 Module descriptions

## methodology/common/exposure.py

```python
from methodology.common.exposure import raster_to_points, assign_rwi
```

**`raster_to_points(raster_path: str) → GeoDataFrame`**
Converts a GeoTIFF population raster to a point GeoDataFrame. Each valid, positive-population pixel becomes a point at its centroid. Returns a GeoDataFrame with a `population` column and the raster's original CRS.

**`assign_rwi(population_points: GeoDataFrame, rwi_path: str) → GeoDataFrame`**
Assigns the nearest Relative Wealth Index value to each population point via a nearest-neighbor spatial join. Reprojects both datasets to EPSG:3857 for accurate distance computation. Returns the input GeoDataFrame with an added `rwi` column.

## methodology/floods/impact.py

```python
from methodology.floods.impact import sample_flood_exposure, calculate_annual_average, aggregate_to_boundaries
```

**`sample_flood_exposure(population_points, flood_maps_dir, return_periods, threshold=0.1) → GeoDataFrame`**
Samples flood depth at each population point for every return period using array-based raster indexing (`data[rows, cols]`). Pixel row/col indices are computed once and reused across all return periods (which share the same raster grid). Points with depth > `threshold` (m) are marked as exposed. Returns the input GeoDataFrame with added `exposed_{rp}` columns containing the population count if exposed, 0 otherwise.

**`calculate_annual_average(gdf, return_periods, exposed_col_prefix="exposed_", output_col="epop_ave") → GeoDataFrame`**
Computes the Annual Average affected Population (AAP) via vectorized trapezoidal integration over annual exceedance probabilities (AEP = 1/return_period):

```
AAP = AEP_max × E_max − trapezoid(E, AEP)
```

Fully vectorized using NumPy — no row-wise iteration. Returns the GeoDataFrame with an added `epop_ave` column.

**`aggregate_to_boundaries(population_points, boundaries, return_periods) → GeoDataFrame`**
Spatially joins population points to administrative boundary polygons and aggregates exposure. Returns the boundaries GeoDataFrame with added columns:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pop_tot` | Total population within the boundary |
| `epop_{rp}` | Exposed population at each return period |
| `epop_ave` | Annual Average affected Population (AAP) |
